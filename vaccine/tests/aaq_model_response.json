No step in the development, testing or regulation process has been skipped for these vaccines.\r\n\r\nWhen they are developed, all vaccines are thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and work well.\r\n\r\nEvery vaccine also needs to be approved by the medical regulators in each country to make sure that they are safe.\r\n\r\nWatch: youtu.be/AeSSyjhz8Hk"],["Do vaccines work against COVID-19 variants?","SA is using vaccines that are proven effective against the COVID-19 variant that is common here.\r\n\r\nAll viruses change over time; this is normal. Different variants can show different properties. The variant commonly found in SA spreads more quickly but is not more deadly than other variants.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 vaccines cause a broad immune response that involves a range of antibodies and cells. This means that changes to the virus should not make vaccines completely ineffective. \r\n\r\nResearch is continuing to check how effective each of the vaccines is against new variants of the virus."],["Do we know what's in the vaccines?","Vaccine manufacturers must list their ingredients to the medicines regulator (SAHPRA) before the vaccine can be approved for use in South Africa. \r\n\r\nAll the ingredients in a vaccine help ensure they are safe and effective for you and your family. \r\n\r\nVaccine ingredients can look unfamiliar when listed on a label but they occur naturally in the human body, the natural environment and the foods we eat."]]}
